# Introduction

A ton of libraries exist with the sole purpose of helping you build your next UI library / Design System and rightfully
so.
Building a UI library is hard. Especially one that is pretty, accessible, functional and user/developer friendly.

The problem is, every UI libraries are incomplete. Maybe they don't have all the components you need, they
don't fit the way you want to use them, or maybe they have exactly everything you need except for one tiny feature that
requires customization.

Gives a lot of headaches, doesn't it? Fear not, Bearmean is absolutely not going to solve all that... but it might be a
pretty good painkiller.

The goal of Bearmean is to help you make your own UI library / Design System with the bare minimum that **you define**
and **build upon that**.
It's not a library but a collection of tools to help you achieve that goal.

Bearmean includes:

1. Well-thought-out layout components that can help you glue your components together without a line of CSS.
2. Simple token definition out of the box. Just exported objects. No configuration needed.
3. Props definition utilities to know exactly which props you use and where.
4. A CLI tool to help you copy/paste your components in your next project if you decide to make your library reusable.

## What is my bare minimum?

Your bare minimum can be a lot of things depending on your standards.
But here are some use cases that could interest you:
