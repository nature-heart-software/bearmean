# Introduction

A ton of UI libraries exist with the sole purpose of helping you build your own UI library / Design System and
rightfully
so, building a UI library is hard, especially one that is pretty, accessible, functional and user/developer friendly.

The problem is, every UI libraries, by nature, are incomplete. Maybe they don't have all the components you need, they
don't fit the way you want to use them, or maybe they have exactly everything you need except for one tiny feature that
requires customization.

Gives a lot of headaches, doesn't it? Fear not, Bearmean is absolutely not going to solve all that... but it might be a
pretty good painkiller.

The goal of Bearmean is to help you make your own UI library / Design System with the bare minimum requirements that *
*you
define**
and **build upon that** with the limited but reasonable collection of tools provided.

Bearmean includes:

1. Well-thought-out layout components that can help you glue your components together without a line of CSS or CSS
   class.
2. Simple token definition out of the box. Just exported constants. No configuration needed.
3. Props definition utilities to control the spread of your props.
4. A CLI tool to help you copy and paste your components in a new project to extend their functionality.
